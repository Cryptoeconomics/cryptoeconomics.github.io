<p>This book is my attempt to understand the future of the world economy, and I need your help writing it! I’m Mehak Ganju, a 16-year-old high school student from Naperville, Illinois, and I’m the editor of Cryptoeconomy,a collection of writings on cryptocurrencies and the  emerging blockchain economy. If you’re an engineer, writer, blogger, or investor in the space and would like to contribute to this collection, please reach out to mehakganju@gmail.com
</p>

<p>Today, proponents of distributed ledger technologies (“blockchains”) are seeking to reshape the monetary, financial, and legal basis of the world economy. The actions of my generation will most significantly shape whether they succeed. It is also my generation that will be most impacted by a transformed economic order. With that in mind, I’m aiming to organize my understanding of this new technology by collecting the thoughts of prominent cryptoeconomic thinkers and innovators in this volume.
</p>
 
 <p>Cryptoeconomy seeks to be collection of writings on the blockchain, compiled with the help of experts in economics, finance, law, and computer science. Because the technology has the potential to so broadly impact society, there are no shortage of diverse opinions. In this collection, I hope to put forth and represent many sides. 
</p>

<p>Ultimately, this book represents a snapshot in time of a growing technology. Some of it will fast become obsolete, while other parts will continue to be relevant. This book is about the future. Our future. Thanks for reading!</p>
