<p class="lead">About the Book.</p>

<p>We aim to elaborate better instruments for direct participation in the decisions of democratic governments, especially in the legislative sphere. In their current forms, referendums are vulnerable to many of the same problems as elections: misinformation through the corporate control of media; corruption through vote buying and targeted advertising; and inequalities of participation by class, age, race, and gender.</p>

<p>We are designing more sophisticated instruments of public consultation that might facilitate deeper deliberation, weaken the influence of money, and equalize the conditions of participation. Moreover, we are developing techniques that might feasibly lower the barriers to citizens' initiatives and thus enable more direct forms of democracy at a large scale.</p>

<p>We promote collaboration between researchers in diverse fields—from political anthropology to constitutional law to computer science—and social movements for reform of the political system. Our hope is to stimulate public debate about the possible instruments of democracy in technical depth.</p>
