We would love your help in writing this book! The table of contents and chapter summaries currently written are meant to guide the narrative of the book. If you are inspired by any of them please reach out and contribute towards that chapter. Alternatively, if you have your own ideas for what belongs in the book please feel free to share them with us. If you have any blog posts or other material you have written that you think should be adapted to fit in the book we want to hear your ideas. We can’t guarantee that all contributions will be included in the final book since the ultimate narrative of the book is still to be determined.

All submissions may be edited and revised before final publication, but final say on all materials will belong to their respective authors. For now, the book will remain a live web book which may continuously undergo revisions and additions. Ultimately, we would like to have the book published in print form. We don’t know enough legalese to say this formally, but if the book is published we plan to distribute all proceeds to the authors of each of the chapters in some fair way. If you know anything about publishing, we can clearly use your help!

<b> To contact us please send an email to <a href="mailto:mehakganju@gmail.com">mehakganju@gmail.com</a>.</b>

The code for this website is also open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/Cryptoeconomics/cryptoeconomics.github.io">GitHub</a>. It’s the first website I have ever coded, so I would appreciate your feedback.
