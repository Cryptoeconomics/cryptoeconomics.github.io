title: Becoming A Part of this Project 
---

If you are thinking of contributing to this project the first step is to choose which section that would be. If it is a section in progress you may still contribute to it, in progress just means there are others writing pieces for that section as well. Also if you have ideas of other chapters that aren't already there please feel free to make a recommendation as this is a very loose template of what the book may end up looking like. Once you do submit a contribution it will be edited by Mehak Ganju, the editor if the book, to make sure it your submission flows with the rest of its section and the book. Even though your piece will be edited you will receive credit for writing said section and get the last say on what is published. Also as of now this book will be a free online book, but if you know any publishers that you could get, Mehak in touch with that would help greatly. If you have anymore questions or concerns or want to know how you can contribute please contact the editor of the book, <a href="mailto:mehakganju@gmail.com">Mehak Ganju.</a>

Here is my<a href="https://github.com/Cryptoeconomics"> Github</a> if you would like to see how I made this website. This is my first time programming a website so if you have any feedback or recommendations I will gladly take them.
